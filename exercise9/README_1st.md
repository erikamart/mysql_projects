# How to Use These Files
Steps:  
1. Read the file 'chapter10notes.md'. It will instruct you to read Chapter 10 in the book and provide notes to follow along.
2. View my College Football Database design documents as another example to make your own. This is my personal project that I created using the exercise instructions in the notes file. *NOTE: The files can only be opened and viewed in the MySQL Workbench graphical interface*:

# How to Use These Files
Steps:  
1. Exercise 9 Instructions

   ### **Objective:**
   - Select a real world application that would require a database.
   - Identify the entities and data fields that would be required by the application.
   - Normalize your data fields into relational database tables.
   - Identify primary and foreign keys.  

   ### **Requirements:**
   - Identify a real world application that would require a database. This could be a business, an organization or a specific area within a business or organization (i.e. human resources, payables and receivables, etc.) - Identify 3 major entities involved in the application. For example, if you were doing a college scheduling application, the entities would be students, classes and instructors.
   - For each entity, identify the information about the entities (data fields) that would be needed. You should have about 8-15 fields for each entity.
   - Using the identified entities and data fields, go through the data normalization process to identify the tables that would be needed for a relational database.
   - Assign valid SQL fieldnames to each field.
   - Identify a primary key for each table.
   - Identify the foreign keys that would be needed.
   - Use the data modeling utilities in the workbench to create a new EER diagram for your database or if you are using a different SQL interface you may attach a text file of your diagram.  

   Refer to my college football database files as an example of using the instructions above.
2. View my College Football Database design documents as another example to make your own. This is my personal project that I created using the exercise instructions in the notes file. *NOTE: The files can only be opened and viewed in the MySQL Workbench graphical interface*:

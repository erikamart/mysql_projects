# How to Use These Files
Steps:  
1. Read the file `chapter12-18notes.md.` It will instruct you to read Chapter 12 & 18 in the book and provide notes to follow along. At the end of the file are the instructions for Exercise 11.
2. View my files to see how I met the requirements of the exercise:  
   - `college_football.mwb`: is simply for informational purpose and is an updated MySQL Workbench graphical interface file. It has changes and is different than the file created during Exercise 9. 
   - `college_footballDB_update.sql`: should be used to update the existing database created in previous exercises. This will ensure the exercise 11 .sql file will work.
   - `exercise11.sql`: holds the sql statements used to complete the requirements of exercise 11. It will create 3 views in the database when executed.

# MySQL Project
This is a collection of projects and notes made while learning MySQL.  
<hr> 
<br>  

## Software/Materials Needed  
-  The book *Murach's MySQL* by Joel Murach.
- [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- An IDE like VS Code if you just want to view some files.

## File Structure
Folders are in numerical order. Follow them sequentially. Within each folder is a notes file in markdown format. That file will have most of the information needed to use the other files.
